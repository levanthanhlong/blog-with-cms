It has been two years since Brazilian midfielder Casemiro made his move from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and he has already banked an inspired performance in our first Premier League game of 2024/25 against Fulham.



The battling midfielder made the journey from Madrid to Old Trafford with significant fanfare, arriving as one of the most decorated players in world football, counting five Champions Leagues and a Copa America among his silverware collection.



Landing as one of the first signings under Erik ten Hag's tenure, he has continued adding to his trophy cabinet under the Dutchman, clinching the Carabao Cup in his debut season with the Reds - where he scored the all-important opener against Newcastle United - and making vital contributions on our road to Emirates FA Cup glory last season, including the last-minute winner at Nottingham Forest.

He marked this two-year milestone with a characteristic Casemiro performance against the Cottagers; marshalling the central unit with grit and determination, and providing a creative spark from deep going forward. It contained all the ingredients likely to set him up for a successful season at Old Trafford.
